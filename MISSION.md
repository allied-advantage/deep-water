# Opportunity Engine — Mission

## Purpose

Find, validate, build, and launch money-making opportunities autonomously.

**Not** random ideas. **Not** theoretical potential. **Validated, buildable, launchable businesses** with clear revenue paths.

## The Three Questions

Every opportunity must answer:

1. **Who has acute pain?** (Not mild inconvenience—*hair on fire* problems)
2. **What makes now different?** (AI? Regulation? Market shift?)
3. **Can Austin build it in <2 weeks?** (Existing tools, existing skills)

## Strategic Filters

### 🚂 The Railroad Question
> "Are we building the railroad, or using the railroad?"

**Use the railroad.** Let OpenAI/Google/Anthropic build infrastructure. We build vertical applications on top. Lower risk, faster to revenue.

### 📊 The Phase Filter
- **Phase 1 (Infrastructure):** Not our game
- **Phase 2 (Platform):** Maybe, if niche is small
- **Phase 3 (Vertical Application):** **THIS IS OUR GAME**

### 🎯 The Alignment Filter
Austin's wheelhouse:
- Real estate + sales + services
- AI/automation implementation
- Google/Meta Ads + cold outreach
- Voice AI + workflow automation (VAPI, n8n, GHL)

If it doesn't touch these, it needs extraordinary conviction.

## Success Metrics

### Research Loop Success
- **7+/10 score** on: Novelty, TAM, Build Complexity, Time-to-Revenue, Moat Potential
- **Validated** = not just researched, but tested with real data/outreach

### Build Loop Success
- **MVP works** = landing page live, core flow functional, tested
- **Demo-ready** = Austin can show it to a prospect

### GTM Loop Success
- **Launch package complete** = Ads, emails, call scripts ready
- **First customer possible** within 48 hours of Austin approval

## What We're Hunting

**Categories (in priority order):**

1. **Unsexy B2B problems** — Compliance, paperwork, scheduling for trades/SMBs
2. **AI automation gaps** — Things enterprises pay $500/mo for that SMBs can't afford
3. **Regulatory arbitrage** — New rules create new pain (CMMC, OSHA, state-specific)
4. **Information asymmetries** — Public data others haven't packaged
5. **SaaS unbundling** — Expensive tools with features SMBs don't need

## What We're NOT Hunting

- Consumer apps (low ARPU, hard to acquire)
- Marketplaces (chicken-and-egg problem)
- Hardware (capital intensive)
- Anything requiring VC (we bootstrap)
- Phase 1 infrastructure plays

## The Loop

```
Research → Validate → Build → Test → Ship → GTM → Revenue
    ↑                                              │
    └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    (repeat forever)
```

Austin's job: Approve transitions, provide feedback, close deals.
System's job: Everything else.
